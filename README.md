### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a little README File so you guys could get to now me better. I am gonna try not to talk too much ðŸ¤“

Currently I am at the CodersBay in Linz, where all kind of people can learn to code. But only those of us may pass who really, really want to code.
And I am going to be one of those.

If you already had a glince on my CV or LinkedIn profile you may noticed that I did my apprenticeship for an office clerk. 
So how the heck am I turning on things like too much coffee, bugs and deadlocks now?

Well, to be honest, I always loved stuff like riddles, games and playing around with Excel formula. Also I was lucky because almost every school I went on was pretty innovative on computer work. So in some way it was clear, that in every work I did so far I was kind of obsessed about finding ways to get things done faster, more effective and automatically whereever possible.

Therefore I learned Visual Basic by myself in 2019 and tried to develop some kind of ERP for the company I was working at. As you may assume, it wasn't going fast enough but it was a really good lesson for me in putting all the parts and procedures together while keeping an eye on improving effectivity. That helped me a lot in my last 4 years where I had to build up a IT department (we didn't have any IT department till then) and manage all further IT projects, while explaining all these complicated things I just learned myself to others in 'user' language and writing understandable documentations for them. 

That experience showed me, that I indeed love the IT and that I am good in facing challenges.

But the real reason for my coding passion is my grandfather.
He was one of those hardcore old school developers who actually had to write the whole code on his own to get some completely new machine working he just invented himself. The first time I entered his 'working room' at his home, full with fancy monitors, printers, little electronical stuff, robotic prototypes, simulator programs and much more, the little girl I was then got impressed so much that I wanted to be like him too. Growing up I got a little bit off the track (how life goes) but now I'm right back on it and never gonna leave again ðŸ¦¾

There is enough time I 'lost' on the way but I am catching up and am therefore really happy for my ability to learn really fast and for all the support my family offers to me.

If there is anything else you would like to now about me or maybe now a place where I could do my practical training please feel free to contact me by mail (lisa.durdevic@gmx.at) or visit my LinkedIn-profile here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-%C4%91ur%C4%91evi%C4%87-187821217/
