**Hi there** ðŸ‘‹

This is a little README File so you guys could get to now me better. I am gonna try not to talk too much ðŸ¤“

Currently I am at the CodersBay in Linz, where all kind of people can learn to code. But only those of us may pass who really, really want to code.
*And I am going to be one of those.*

If you already had a glince on my CV or LinkedIn profile you may noticed that I did my apprenticeship for an *office clerk*. 
**So how the heck am I turning on things like too much coffee, bugs and deadlocks now?**

Well, to be honest, I always loved stuff like riddles, games and playing around with Excel formula. Also I was lucky because almost every school I went on was pretty innovative on computer work. So in some way it was clear, that in every work I did so far I was kind of obsessed about finding ways to get things done faster, more effective and as automatically as possible (or as much as my little knowledge allowed me to). Most of my creations are still used in the company where I did my apprenticeship, even after 10 years.

Trying to improve my work so far I learned **Visual Basic by myself** in 2019 and tried to develop some kind of ERP for that company. As you may assume, it wasn't going fast enough but it was a really good lesson for me in putting all the parts and procedures together while keeping an eye on improving effectivity. That helped me a lot in my last 4 years where I had to **build up the internal IT department** in that same company and manage all further **IT projects**, while explaining all these complicated things I just learned myself to others in 'user' language and writing understandable documentations for them. One colleague loved to say "Explain it to me like a housewife". 

**That experience showed me that I indeed love the IT as much as to 'dive' into a software's structure and it teached me to face challenges (including housewifes).**

But the real reason for my coding passion is my **grandfather**.
He was one of those hardcore old school developers who actually had to write the whole code on his own to get some completely new machine working he just invented himself and to manually search for that one missing comma within *hundrets of lines* of code. The first time I entered his 'home working room', full with monitors, printers, fancy little electronical stuff, robotic prototypes, simulator programs and much more, that little girl (me) was impressed so much that I wanted to be like him too. Growing up I got a little bit off the track (how life goes) but now I'm right back on it and **never gonna leave again ðŸ¦¾**

So I started to search *the* course to learn coding, sorted things out at work before quitting and now here I am - at **CodersBay**. Learning **Java, SQL, HTML5, CSS ...**

There is enough I still need to learn but I am keeping the pace, thanks to the support my **family, colleagues and trainers** offer to me. ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–
